                    of the British Home Championship, took place in 1884. As football grew in popularity in other parts of the world 
                    at the turn of the 20th century, it was held as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 
                    Summer Olympics (however, the IOC has retroactively upgraded their status to official events), and at the 1906

                    Football Association (FA), England's football governing body, the event was for amateur players only and was 
                    regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the England national 
                    amateur football team) won the gold medals. They repeated the feat in 1912 in Stockholm.</td>

                    organised the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy tournament in Turin in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between 
                    individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each one of which represented an entire nation. The 
                    competition is sometimes described as The First World Cup, and featured the most prestigious professional club sides 
                    from Italy, Germany and Switzerland, but the FA of England refused to be associated with the competition and declined 
                    the offer to send a professional team. Lipton invited West Auckland, an amateur side from County Durham, to represent 
                    England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title.</td>

                    amateurs", and took responsibility for managing the event.This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental 
                    football competition, at the 1920 Summer Olympics, contested by Egypt and 13 European teams, and won by Belgium. 
                    Uruguay won the next two Olympic football tournaments in 1924 and 1928. Those were also the first two open world 
                    championships, as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era.</td>
