                Russia has thousands of rivers and inland bodies of water, providing it with one of the world's largest surface water resources. Its lakes contain approximately<br>
                one-quarter of the world's liquid fresh water. The country is a federation and semi-presidential republic, wherein the President is the head of state, and the<br>
                Prime Minister is the head of government. The Russian Federation consisted of eighty-five federal subjects that are constituent members of the Federation.<br>
                President: Vladimir Putin Prime Minister: Dmitry Medvedev As of 1 January 2017, the population of Russia is 146,877,08. Throughout much of the territory<br>
                there are only two distinct seasons—winter and summer—as spring and autumn are usually brief periods of change between extremely low and extremely high<br>
                temperatures. The coldest month is January (February on the coastline); the warmest is usually July. Great ranges of temperature are typical. In winter,<br>
                temperatures get colder both from south to north and from west to east. Summers can be quite hot, even in Siberia.</p>
