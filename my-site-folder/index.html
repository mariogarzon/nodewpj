                    the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition. Places in the tournament 
                    were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup. The first qualification

                    place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg on 25 July 2015 at 18:00 local time.</td>
